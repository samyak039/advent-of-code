# Advent of Code

**Advent of Code** is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like. People use them as [interview](https://y3l2n.com/2018/05/09/interview-prep-advent-of-code/) [prep](https://twitter.com/dznqbit/status/1037607793144938497), [company training](https://twitter.com/pgoultiaev/status/950805811583963137), [university](https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home) [coursework](https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2021/index.html), [practice](https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584) [problems](https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/), a [speed contest](https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard), or to [challenge each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on).

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some [problem solving skills](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/) will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to [Shareon Twitter Mastodon] it with others, or directly via PayPal or Coinbase.

## General Tips

If you get stuck, try your solution against the **examples** given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers. If not, re-read the description. Did you misunderstand something? Is your program doing something you don't expect? After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, **build some test cases** for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program. Make sure you have the entire puzzle input. If you're still stuck, maybe **ask a friend** for help, or come back to the puzzle later. You can also ask for hints in the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).
